# Contribution Guidelines

Here I describe the potential contributing situations. Contributors could follow the hints below.

## If adding a link to a paper or a piece of resource

Please open a new Pull Request and append the line(s) to the bottom of the current directory of your target topic/subtopic, in the form of 

```

* [Paper Name](publicly-accessible-link-to-the-paper) - ***Journal/Conference/Maintainer/Initiator***, year. [[All Versions](link-to-google-scholar-all-versions-page-for-the-paper)]. [[Resource Name](publicly-accessible-link-to-the-paper)]. Discription in natural language.

```

Please ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines:

- Search previous suggestions before making a new one, as yours may be a duplicate.
- Make an individual pull request for each suggestion.
- Titles should be [capitalized](http://grammar.yourdictionary.com/capitalization/rules-for-capitalization-in-titles.html).
- Keep descriptions short and simple.
- End all descriptions with a full stop/period.
- Order link titles alphabetically within each category.
- Check your spelling and grammar.
- Make sure your text editor is set to remove trailing whitespace.
- Try to make your Pull request and title as descriptive as possible.
- All open source applications should have the [OSS symbol](https://github.com/iCHAIT/awesome-osx/blob/master/media/oss.svg), the primary link for the application should point to the application's website and the OSS symbol should link to the source code. In case the application does not have any website then both the links should point to the source code.
- New categories or improvements to the existing categorization are welcome.

Thank you for your suggestions!
